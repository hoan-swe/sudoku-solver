# Sudoku Solver! (or mostly-solver!)

## Overview

Sudoku is a classic 9x9 grid puzzle. The initial puzzle contains some filled cells with numbers from 1 to 9. 
The objective is to fill in the empty cells so that each row, column, and the nine 3x3 subgrids includes every number from 1 to 9 without repetition.</br></br>
This program is not just a solver; it's a strategic thinker. It stores an unsolved sudoku puzzle in a 2D list and takes on the challenge of solving it, ***without resorting to brute-force and backtracking.***
The program stops when the puzzle is solved or when further progress requires guessing.

## Planned Future Features/Improvement Todos:
* Add user interfaces
* Add graphics and create a standalone application
* Implement puzzle scanning using the device's camera.
